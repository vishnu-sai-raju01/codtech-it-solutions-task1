OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
PROJECT: Push button counter(Embedded systems)
* Counts number of button presses using Arduino
* Displays the count on Serial Monitor
* Great for learning digital inputs and debouncing

 COMPONENTS:
* Arduino Uno/Nano – 1
* Push Button – 1
* 10kΩ Resistor – 1
* Jumper Wires, Breadboard
* (Optional: LCD/7-Segment Display)

 CIRCUIT:
* Button → Pin 2
* 10kΩ Resistor → GND
* Other button end → 5V
* Pull-down configuration used

WORKING:
* Reads button press on pin 2
* Increments count when pressed
* Displays count on Serial Monitor
* Delay added to debounce
